        <p>The article '10 Intriguing Photographs to Teach Close Reading and Visual Thinking Skills' talks about different ways to analyze meaning and design elements within a photograph to find more details or answers than just a single glance could. As someone who works as a photographer, I'm already extremely familar with the concept of close reading photographs. It prompts you to ask open-ended questions about the context of the photo, and figure out what it means. For the webside Prometheus Fuels, which tells an interactive story about how the company is creating fuel from air, invites users to move their mouse, rotating in 3D space as well as scroll to explore imagery and reveal more of the story. </p>

        <p>The article talks about creating forms that users actually want to use, specifically uncomplicating and showing the process to them as they complete the form. You should break up the options and answers into more manageable chunks, and even show them where they are and how far away they are from completing the form itself. All the information should be visually accessible but uncomplicated. My first thought of well-done forms are those personality quizzes from places like quizilla or uquiz, where you selection options and then are presented with an answer based on those options.</p>
