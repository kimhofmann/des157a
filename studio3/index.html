    <p>There are two players. The player whose turn it is attempts to hack the system. The total of the attempt is added to the current player's unit total, unless either number comes up as a "one". If this happens, this player's turn is over, and it is the other player’s turn. After each attemot, the current player can either hack again, (assuming a "one" was not found) or if the current player feels that luck is running thin, they can pass to the other player. The first player to get 30 units or higher wins.</p> 
    <p>Oh, and if you find two ones or two sixs, the system resets and your current score gets zeroed out. So don’t do that.</p>
