        <h2><span class="ab">&lt;</span>project overview<span class="ab">&gt;</span></h2>

        <p>For my final project, I will be remastering my every picture project to add better and more interactive functionality and a better, cleaner and more minimalistic design concept</p>

        <h2><span class="ab">&lt;</span>project goals<span class="ab">&gt;</span></h2>

        <p>My project goals are to take what I current have for the every picture project and expand it to include more books from my personal collection, as well as update the design to be more cohesive and clean with better JS intergration.</p>

        <h2><span class="ab">&lt;</span>design strategies<span class="ab">&gt;</span></h2>

        <p> I want to clean up the design a lot, with better and less pixelated AI created images for the books as well as make my own background in Illustrator that better aligns with the concept I want to convey.</p>

        <h2><span class="ab">&lt;</span>interaction strategies<span class="ab">&gt;</span></h2>

        <p>I want to add more overlays to the project, and turn the horizonal format into a vertical one, so that the images appear as you scroll past the books, through the different sections of fiction and non-fiction. I also want users to be able to click a button and have my written review text appear alongside the images.</p>

        <h2><span class="ab">&lt;</span>experience goals<span class="ab">&gt;</span></h2>

        <p>Overall, I want the design to be clean and lean, where users feel like the information is presented in an uncomplicated way that maybe could convince them to purchase or read these books themselves</p>
